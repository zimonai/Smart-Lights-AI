# Smart Lights

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The AI will be implemented into traffic lights. The AI will use a priority system in order to make traffic as smooth as possible and make sure that noone waits at a traffic light for too long. It will also make sure that emergency personel can ride through traffic smoothly when needed. 


## Background

The AI will solve traffic stocking and it will help people get to places in time. It will also make sure that emergency personel can get to places fast and easy. Since there will be less traffic stocking, the AI will help in creating smarter and greaner cities. This is because vehicles won't have to wait at traffic lights as long and therefore they will not produce as much emissions. 


## How is it used?

The AI will be used in both new and old traffic lights. It will be implemented into new traffic lights as well as old. To reduce costs it will be easy to install into older traffic lights, which makes sure that no new traffic lights will have to be produced in order for the AI to be used. Everyone in society can use the benefits of the AI since it will also make sure that pedestrians won't have to wait as long at traffic lights at crossings. 

## Data sources and AI methods
The AI will use a camera and microphone to get it's data. It will use these components to decide which light to turn green and which light to turn red. It will also use these components to detect emergency vehicles. Besides from this, it will comunicate with other traffic lights in order to make traffic smooth and better for the environment. 

## Challenges

Of course the AI won't solve the problem with bad drivers etc. However, it will be a big step in the direction to make traffic efficient and green. 

## What next?

The projekt would need investors etc. It would also need to be developed by some big company in order to be something that actually works in the end.
